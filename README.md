# Automated Learning and Data Analysis for Picnic Weather Prediction

This repository contains code for an Automated Learning and Data Analysis project focused on predicting picnic weather suitability in Dresden, Europe. The project emphasizes interpretability in weather prediction models and utilizes Decision Tree (DT), Attention Neural Network (Att-NN), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models.

## Project Overview

The project aimed to predict a day's weather suitability for picnics in Dresden, emphasizing interpretability in weather prediction models. It explored yearly weather patterns and sought insights into influential factors and seasonal weather trends impacting picnic-friendliness.

## Conclusion Highlights

- **Model Performances:** Decision Tree model exhibited exceptional accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, outperforming neural network models due to dataset simplicity.
- **Feature Importance:** Maximum temperature and precipitation collectively accounted for 100% importance, highlighting their pivotal role in picnic suitability prediction.
- **Yearly Weather Patterns:** Analysis using kernel density estimates visualized seasonal variations in weather variables, offering valuable insights.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/weather-prediction). Please download the dataset to replicate the experiments and run the code.
